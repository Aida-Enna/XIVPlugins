  "Description": "When you click \"Update Gear Set\", this plugin will automatically update and save your portrait to match your new glam.\n\nThis plugin is in testing and will have one more issues, laid out below:\n\n- Rarely, a glitched desynth window will pop up when saving the gearset instead of it saving the portrait. This is being investigated, closing the window and swapping classes seems to fix it.\n\nPlease report issues/bugs on the Github website by clicking the globe icon.",
