  Allows for a macro to continue onto the next macro by using '/nextmacro' on the last line of a macro.
  Adding '/nextmacro' on the last line of Macro #01 will automatically execute Macro #02
  Adding '/nextmacro down' on the last line of Macro #01 will automatically execute Macro #11
  Also allows executing any macro from chat using '/runmacro'
punchline: Run multiple macros one after the other.
