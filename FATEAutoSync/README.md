# FATEAutoSync

(Originally created by [Tenrys](https://github.com/Tenrys) and updated to work with the new Dalamud API, along with new features!)

Automatically synchronizes the level of your character (and optionally auto-enables tank stance!) whenever you join a FATE in Final Fantasy XIV.

`/autofate` to toggle without uninstalling the plug-in.

`/autostance` to toggle auto tank stancing on/off.
