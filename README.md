# Aida Enna's XIV Plugin Repo

If you want to use these plugins, add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aida-Enna/XIVPlugins/main/repo.json` to your Dalamud repo list. 

These are plugins which were abandoned by their creators/maintainers that I've fixed up and added new features to. For their protection, their names are now omitted.

## Auto Login

Automatically logs into the specified character (selected via the configuration menu) when FFXIV first starts.

## Fate Auto Sync

Automatically synchronizes the level of your character (and optionally auto-enables tank stance!) whenever you join a FATE in Final Fantasy XIV.

## Food Check

See who is missing food buff at countdown start and optionally post to party/echo chat with a customizable message.

# Deprecated Plugins

## Loot Master

Adds various commands to need, greed, or pass on all loot.

NOTE: Deprecated, [use this instead](https://github.com/PunishXIV/LazyLoot).

## Potato Famine 2

Changes lalafells (or everyone or specific people) into another race of your choosing.

NOTE: Deprecated because it was more of a meme than anything and AFAIK no one ever actually used it.
