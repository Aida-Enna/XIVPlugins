# Aida Enna's XIV Plugin Repo

If you want to use these plugins, add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aida-Enna/XIVPlugins/main/repo.json` to your Dalamud repo list. 

These are plugins which were abandoned by their creators/maintainers that I've fixed up and added new features to. For their protection, their names are now omitted.

## Auto Login

Automatically logs you into a specified character when the game first opens, and optionally reconnects you to the game (and notifies you) when you get disconnected.

## Auto Pillion

When a party member gets on a mount that supports more than 1 person and is close enough, you will automatically get on.

## Macro Chain Redux

A fork of the original macro chain, this re-adds support for running a macro inside of a macro.

## Portrait Fixer

When you click "Update Gear Set", this plugin will automatically update and save your portait to match your new glam.

# Deprecated plugins

## Food Check

See who is missing food buff at countdown start and optionally post to party/echo chat with a customizable message.

This is now a main repo plugin - You will need to delete the custom repo version (using the trash can icon) and then make sure testing builds is enabled (/xlsettings -> Experimental tab -> Receive plugin testing builds), and it should show up.
